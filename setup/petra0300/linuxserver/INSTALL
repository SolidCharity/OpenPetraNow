required packages:
 sudo (for the initialisation of the database)
 mono-opt package, available for Debian, Ubuntu and CentOS from http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Atpokorra%3Amono&package=mono-opt
 one of the following RDBMS:
   postgresql (recommended, default)
   mysql

The default configuration for the server is to use postgresql. But mysql should theoretically work as well, but might need some testing. Sqlite is not recommended for the use on Linux with this tar.gz file.

Installation of Mono for OpenPetra:
 Follow the instructions at http://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=home%3Atpokorra%3Amono&package=mono-opt
 For example for CentOS 6 64 bit:
 cd /etc/yum.repos.d/
 wget http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:tpokorra:openpetra/CentOS_CentOS-6/home:tpokorra:openpetra.repo
 yum install mono-opt mono-xsp-opt

You will need EPEL probably as well (for lighttpd):
 rpm -Uhv http://mirror.de.leaseweb.net/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-8.noarch.rpm

Installation of Postgresql 9.2:
Have a look here for the right URL: http://yum.postgresql.org/repopackages.php#pg92
 On CentOS 6, 64 bit:
 rpm -Uhv http://yum.postgresql.org/9.2/redhat/rhel-6-x86_64/pgdg-centos92-9.2-6.noarch.rpm

firewall: 
in order for clients to connect from outside, you need to open port 80 (or 443)
eg if you are using iptables, add such a line:
/sbin/iptables -A int-in -j ACCEPT -p tcp --dport 80

Move the contents of this directory to eg. /usr/local/openpetraorg.
Copy the file openpetraorg-server.sh to /etc/init.d/openpetra-server, and change the configuration parameters in the head of that file.
Create symbolic links:
  ln -s /usr/local/openpetraorg/asmx /var/www/openpetra
  ln -s /usr/local/openpetraorg/bin30 /var/www/openpetra/bin
Download one of the available base or demo databases from https://sourceforge.net/projects/openpetraorg/files/openpetraorg/demodata/
and save it to /usr/local/openpetraorg/db30/base.yml.gz

For initialising the installation, and loading this base database:
  /etc/init.d/openpetra-server init

To start the server, type:
  /etc/init.d/openpetra-server start

To see the menu and administrate the server, type:
  /etc/init.d/openpetra-server menu

To install a base database:
  Download one of the available databases from https://sourceforge.net/projects/openpetraorg/files/openpetraorg/demodata/
  then go into the OpenPetra menu, and use option i for importing the database from the yml.gz file

To stop the server, type:
  /etc/init.d/openpetra-server stop

To backup the database, type:
  /etc/init.d/openpetra-server backup

To restore the database from a backup, type:
  /etc/init.d/openpetra-server restore

To see the technical interface of the server:
  go to http://<yourserver>/openpetra9000/serverSessionManager.asmx
